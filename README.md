# matsim-example-project

A small example of how to use MATSim as a library, forked from matsim-org/matsim-example-project

This project runs matsim examples with following functionalities: 

-convert SILO (github/msmobility/silo) synthetic population into travel demand for matsim

-run multiple matsim configurations varying scaling factors, storage factors and capacity factors

-get travel time matrices, travel distance matrices and euclidean matrices given a list of TAZ or centroids

-assign transit and get skim matrices for transit, including total time, in vehicle time, acces time, etc. 


-execute AV examples using the robotaxi matsim extension

-run multimodal simulations using the multimodal extension

-analyze events to get individual travel times
